                    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
                    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
                    <p>
                        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt. Or, as Dr. Campbell puts it:
                        “It refers to the physiological changes in the brain that happen as the result of our
                        interactions with our environment. From the time the brain begins to develop in utero until the
                        day we die, the connections among the cells in our brains reorganize in response to our changing
                        needs. This dynamic process allows us to learn from and adapt to different experiences” –
                        Celeste Campbell (n.d.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This benefits us as we can it means you can learn an old dog new tricks, because our brain is
                        constantly changing depending on external stimuli. When we learn something new our brain creates
                        new connections and as such the brain is constantly growing and evolving.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
                    <p>
                        As neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to create new pathways as we learn we can keep our
                        brain evolving by keeping up our learning. We can keep the brain active and growing by pushing
                        ourselves every day. Learning new abilities such as a new instrument or language are the best at
                        creating new pathways.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Get enough sleep – we need to ensure that we get enough sleep so that the brain can efficiently
                        reset and create new connections.<br>
                        Keep learning – Learning a new skill such as a new instrument or a new language is an optimal
                        way to create new connections.<br>
                        Physical exercise – Physical exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise, increases the blood
                        flow to the brain and in turn the amount of oxygen the brain receives. This helps the brain
                        grow.<br>
                        Reduce stress – Stress kills neuroplasticity and therefore should be avoided.<br>
                        Find a strong purpose – you are more likely to create new connections if you are excited and
                        motivated about what you are learning as this will make you more alert.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Discuss what the Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant</h3>
                    <p>
                        Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and
                        input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed
                        mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts)
                    </P>
                    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was surprised by the fact that the brain physically changes as a part of neuroplasticity. The
                        fact that thinking has a physical impact on our body is extraordinary. Also, I found that growth
                        mindset and neuroplasticity linked together very closely.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am very interested in what I am learning and therefore have strong purpose to learn these new
                        skills, this will make me more alert and therefore increase the effectiveness of
                        neuroplasticity. Whenever I am struggling with something, I can tell myself that even though I
                        may not know this yet, with neuroplasticity and a growth mindset I can learn to understand it.
                    </p>
