                    <h1>Learning reflections</h1>
                    <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
                    <p>Long term goal for me is to become a successful full stack developer and have an overall
                        successful career in the IT industry. And if I could integrate these skills into my other
                        passion for aviation that would be fantastic.</p>
                    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at
                        EDA?</h3>
                    <p>I would like to learn how look inward better and make sure that I accurately communicate my
                        feeling as part of larger team.</p>
                    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
                    <p>As discussed in my Sprint 1 blog my strengths are that I am a very eager and quick learner and I
                        generally pick things up fairly quickly.<br>
                        One of my limitations is that sometimes I can get distracted and veer off task rather than
                        getting the work that needs to be done. This means that once I am back on task, I often need to
                        work harder to make up for the time that I lost.</p>
                    <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
                        programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
                        productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
                        representatives.</h3>
                    <p>My goal for foundations is to lay a healthy groundwork for my time during bootcamp. As I have
                        some background knowledge with computers and a little with coding I can work at a reasonably
                        comfortable pace. However, I strive to put in the hours required everyday as this will get me
                        into a routine for the much busier and tougher bootcamp. I also make sure that I do take
                        sufficient breaks and go for a walk on the beach when I can.</p>
                    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
                    <p>First, I would do some research and try and come up with an answer myself, if I am still
                        struggling after this, I will ask my peers or facilitator.</p>
                    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
                    <p>I expect them to be helpful and understanding of everyone's skill level however I also expect
                        them to make us find our own way whenever possible. Simply giving out the answers will not help
                        us in the long run. So, I expect them to be supportive and help us lay our foundations.</p>
                    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For
                        example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan
                        these in.</h3>
                    <p>Luckily, I have very few commitments at the moment and the commitments I do have are very
                        flexible. This means I can give my full attention to the course.</p>
