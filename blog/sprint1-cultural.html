                <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
                <h4><em>“Your beliefs become your thoughts,
                        Your thoughts become your words,
                        Your words become your actions,
                        Your actions become your habits,
                        Your habits become your values,
                        Your values become your destiny.”
                        ― Gandhi</em></h4>
                <h3>What are your personal values?</h3>
                <p><em>Happiness:</em> This is what I would consider to be my main value, Happiness. For me however,
                    this
                    closely relates to personal growth. I feel the happiest when I feel like I have accomplished
                    something, whether that is getting a pat on the back for a job well done, winning in a video game,
                    or even learning something new. I am always looking to try and improve myself and be the best person
                    I can be. </p>
                <p><em>Integrity:</em> This has always been one of my core values which I mainly developed during my
                    education to become a commercial pilot. When learning to fly you spend a lot of time in the air
                    without any direct supervision, this means it is quite easy to get into ‘ah no one will find out’
                    mindset. It is in these moments you need to make the correct decision to compose yourself with
                    integrity. </p>
                <p><em>Learning:</em> This value relates back to the personal growth in relation to my happiness. I
                    strive
                    to learn new things whenever I can, whether this is learning a new skill, learning some new trivia,
                    or learning from a mistake.</p>
                <h3>How has my culture influenced my values and identity?</h3>
                <p>I have always been very lucky when it came to my upbringing and my family culture. My parents have
                    always been extremely supportive in whatever adventure I tried to take on, as long as I put in the
                    effort to succeed.</p>
                <p>When I was younger, I moved to New Zealand from a little old place called Belgium, immediately I fell
                    in love with New Zealand and considered this my home. I am very proud of my parents to have had the
                    courage to pack up our lives and move to the other side of the world.</p>
                <p>My parents have always been extremely hard working and I hope that I have taken on board some of that
                    bravery and the hard-working mentality from them.</p>
                <h3>When have you had to make an ethical decision?</h3>
                <p>While completing my Bachelor's Degree in Aviation I had to do 4 papers as a part of the university
                    component of the degree. One of my friends had completed these exact 4 papers one semester before me
                    and offered to give me their work as a baseline for my own. At first, I contemplated taking my
                    friends work as it would greatly reduce my workload and make passing the papers a breeze.</p>
                <p>When I started thinking of all the blood, sweat, and tears I had put in to get where I got in my
                    degree, I started feeling uncomfortable with taking my friend's work. It felt like I got so far and
                    it would squander the feeling of achievement when I was so close.</p>
                <p>I decided to turn down my friend's suggestion regarding his work, maintain my integrity, and put in
                    the effort myself. I felt that if I was able to maintain my personal values and put in the work
                    needed to complete my degree, it would be a much bigger and better achievement.</p>
                <p>In the end, I passed all my papers on my own and I now have an overwhelming sense of achievement when
                    I think back on my time as a student.</p>
                <h3>Share an example of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance
                    or tension.</h3>
                <p>At my previous work I would often manage a couple of people during the closing shift of a demanding
                    retail environment. Naturally this meant that we had to work productively and we had to work
                    together to get the work done on time. As it was the closing shift the faster we finished, the
                    faster we would be able to go home. At times I would not be able to actively manage the staff due to
                    other responsibilities.</p>

                <p>One example of when I was met with resistance was when I was in charge of closing the shop during a
                    late-night sales day (store closed at 9pm). I was busy dealing with a customer complaint and was not
                    able to actively manage the staff on the floor. When the store closed at 9pm I found that none of
                    the cleaning had been done. So, this meant that we would now have to do all the cleaning and stay
                    later than expected.</p>

                <p>One of my colleagues suggested we only did the bare minimum and left the rest for the opening staff
                    the next day, however I felt uncomfortable with this as it didn’t line up with my integrity value. I
                    disagreed with this and suggested we all work together on the cleaning to get it done faster.
                    Naturally we had to stay a bit later than expected however we got all of the cleaning done like what
                    was expected from us.</p>
                <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
                <p>My strengths are that I am very eager and fast learner, I love learning new things. This in turn will
                keep me motivated through the course as I will be excited to learn something new every day. And I
                believe that in an industry that is constantly changing and you are constantly required to keep
                upskilling I'll stay motivated not just through the course but throughout my career as well. I am also
                very easy-going and easy to get along with so I'll have no problem in working as part of a team.</p>

                <p>My weakness is that I can sometimes get distracted, my brain will suddenly veer off on a tangent and I
                need to make a conscious decision to bring it back on task. This can mean that I sometimes needlessly
                waste some time and need to work harder to make up for this lost time.</p>

                <p>The strength that will help me most in my learning journey is my willingness to learn and my ability to
                retain information.</p>
