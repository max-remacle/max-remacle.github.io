                    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
                    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in
                        positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome
                        challenges and defuse conflict.</p>
                    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                    <p>As stated above EQ is defined as an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, and control
                    emotions. Both in themselves as well as with others. People with high EQ usually make great
                    leaders and team players because of their ability to understand, empathize, and connect with the
                    people around them.</p>
                    <p>IQ is a score derived from standardized tests designed to asses an individual's intelligence.
                    This score can be used to determine academic abilities.</p>
                    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence will help you when trying to enter the workforce as people with a higher
                    EQ generally will have more: self-awareness; more social awareness; better self-management
                    skills; and better relationship management skills.</p>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at work, and achieve your
                    career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention
                    into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you. Furthermore, EQ is a
                    great indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players,
                    and people who work best by themselves.</p>
